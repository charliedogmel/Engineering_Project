# Engineering MVP

This project involves putting many pieces together and working with many new things. Working from the Google Cloud Platform, the marginal emissions data is coming from the WattTime API into MongoDB. As a time series, there were timestamp issues to work through to make sure the database did not end up with duplicate data. The next step is to create visuals and display them using Streamlit which is in progress right now.
